## This is me as a newbie in python and spearing towards penetration testing.
## This built with help of Ai
## This project is a common port scanner , that reveals the port that is open, closed or filtered. This information can be used to establish remote connection.
# Please leave your suggestions and contributions to reveal best ways to achieve this  with a better code
